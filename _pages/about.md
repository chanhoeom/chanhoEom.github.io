I received joint M.S. and Ph.D. degree at the School of [Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University](https://ee.yonsei.ac.kr/ee_en/index.do), under the supervision of [Prof. Bumsub Ham](https://cvlab.yonsei.ac.kr). I worked as a research intern at [Naver CLOVA](https://naver-career.gitbook.io/en/) (Leader: [Dr. YoungJoon Yoo](https://sites.google.com/view/yjyoo3312)). I also have experience as an AI Researcher at [Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT)](https://www.sait.samsung.co.kr), where I contributed to the Autonomous Machine Perception (AMP) project, working under the guidance of [Dr. ByungIn Yoo](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=JNgRAf8AAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests include computer vision and machine/deep learning, particularly image/video retrieval, domain adaptation, and autonomous driving, but not limited to.
