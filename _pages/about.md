I'm Chanho Eom, a student at the School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Yonsei Univeristy, Seoul, Korea, under the supervision of Prof. [Bumsub Ham](https://cvlab.yonsei.ac.kr). My research interests include computer vision and machine/deep learning, particularly image/video retrieval, domain adaptation, and monocular depth estimation.
